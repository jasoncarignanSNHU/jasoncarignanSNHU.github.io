Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This portfolio presents my code review and three enhanced artifacts demonstrating growth across software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each section includes the original and enhanced work, a narrative explaining the improvement, and supporting visuals.

**Professional Focus and Specialization**

My professional focus is Data Science with an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in building data-driven systems that combine clean software architecture, efficient algorithms, and well-structured databases to support reliable decision making.

Through both academic work and professional experience in data and reporting environments, I have developed a strong interest in designing scalable data pipelines, evaluating performance trade-offs, and ensuring data quality and integrity. The artifacts in this portfolio reflect the technical foundation required for AI-enabled systems, including structured problem solving, performance optimization, validation logic, and analytics-ready database design.

**Outcomes Focused on in This Portfolio**

Across the code review, narratives, and enhanced artifacts, this portfolio provides evidence of progress toward the CS 499 outcomes:

1. **Collaboration and decision support:** artifacts are structured and documented for reuse and review by technical and nontechnical stakeholders.  
2. **Professional communication:** clear written narratives, supporting visuals, and organized presentation of original vs. enhanced work.  
3. **Algorithmic design and trade-offs:** performance- and correctness-driven enhancements using appropriate data structures and analysis.  
4. **Modern tools and techniques:** industry-aligned frameworks, workflows, and database features used to deliver measurable improvements.  
5. **Security mindset:** validation, defensive handling, and design choices that reduce risk and protect data integrity.
